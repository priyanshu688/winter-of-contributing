◆ HTML Semantics

→ Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications.
→ Semantic HTML is processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents.
→ A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

▪ Examples of Semantic Elements - 
         <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
▪ Examples of Non-Semantic Elements -
         <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.

◆ CSS Flexbox Layout Module

→ CSS Flexbox Layout is commonly known as "Flexbox", is a CSS3 Web Layout Model. Here, The Flex Layout allows the responsive elements within a container to be automatically arranged depending upon screen size.
→ It is basically used to make the elements behave predictably when they are used with different screen sizes and different display devices.
→ It provides a more efficient way to layout, align and distribute space among items in the container.
→ It is great to use for the general layout of your website or app.

► Two Axes of Flexbox
  In order to work with Flexbox, we need to think and consider in terms of two axes-
          1. The Main Axis 
                   – It is defined by the "Flex-direction" property and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.
                   – It has four possible values:-
                          ▪ row
                          ▪ row-reverse
                          ▪ column
                          ▪ column-reverse
                   – If we choose "row" or "row-reverse" then the main axis will run along the row in the "Inline direction".
                   – If we choose "column" or "column-reverse" then the main axis will run from top of the page to the bottom in the "Block Direction".
                    
          2. The Cross Axis
                   – The Cross Axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your flex-direction is set to "row" or "row-reverse" the cross axis runs down the columns
                   – If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis runs along the rows.
                    
► Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:
                – Block, for sections in a webpage.
                – Inline, for text.
                – Table, for two-dimensional table data.
                – Positioned, for explicit position of an element.
                 
► The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

► Flexbox Elements
      To start using the Flexbox model, you need to first define a flex container.

The element above represents a flex container (the blue area) with three flex items.
     For Example - 
          A flex container with three flex items:
                 <div class="flex-container">
                 <div>1</div>
                 <div>2</div>
                 <div>3</div>
               </div>

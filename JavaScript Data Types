JavaScript Data Types

Primitive values (immutable datum represented directly at the lowest level of the language) Boolean type. Null type. Undefined type. Number type. BigInt type. String type. Symbol type.
Objects (collections of properties)

• JavaScript variables can hold different data types: numbers, strings, objects and more:

let length = 16;                               // Number
let lastName = "Johnson";                      // String
let x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};    // Object

• The Concept of Data Types

In programming, data types is an important concept.
To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.

Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:
                              let x = 16 + "Volvo";
                              Does it make any sense to add "Volvo" to sixteen? Will it produce an error or will it produce a result?

JavaScript will treat the example above as:
                                        let x = "16" + "Volvo";
                                        
JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:
                                                        JavaScript: let x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";  
                                                        
• JavaScript Types are Dynamic

JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:
       For Example - let x;           // Now x is undefined
                     x = 5;           // Now x is a Number
                     x = "John";      // Now x is a String
                     
• JavaScript Strings

A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".
Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:
       For Example -
                     let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";   // Using double quotes
                     
• JavaScript Numbers

JavaScript has only one type of numbers.
Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:

For Example - 
let x1 = 34.00;     // Written with decimals
let x2 = 34;        // Written without decimals                     
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';   // Using single quotes                     

• The typeof Operator

You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.
The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression:

For Example - 
typeof ""             // Returns "string"
typeof "John"         // Returns "string"
typeof "John Doe"     // Returns "string"

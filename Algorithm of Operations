Algorithm of Operations

→ An Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem or sequence of statements which are used to perform task.
→ An Algorithm is a finite set of instructions or logic, written in order to accomplish a certain pre-defined task.
→ It can be expressed either as an "internal high level description as pseudocode" or using "a flowchart".

Different Operations possible over Data Structure are :-

– Inserting                  – Searching
– Deleting                   – Sorting
– Updating                   – Merging
– Traversing                 – Destroying

1. Creating - This is the first operation to create a data structure.
              This is just declaration and initialisation of data structure and reversed memory locations for data structure.
              
2. Insertion - It is used to insert one or more data elements into an array. Based on requirement, new elements can be added at the beginning, end or any given index of array.
               Add the element at the given index.
               
3. Deletion - Deletion refers to removing an existing elements from the array and re-arranging all the elements of an array.
4. Traversal - Traversing a Data Structure means "visiting or touching" the elements of the stucture.
               Sometimes also called as "iterating over data structure".
               In Traversing operation of an array, each element of an array is accessed exactly for once for processing. It is also called visiting of an array.
               
Complexity of an Algorithm is the function which gives running time or space in terms of input size.

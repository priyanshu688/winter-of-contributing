◆ Dynamic Programming and Its Significance

◆ Dynamic Programming
      → Dynamic Programming is both a mathematical optimization and a computer programming method.
      → This Programming approach is quite similar to divide and conquer in breaking down the problem into smaller and yet smaller possible sub-problems. But here, these sub-                   problems are not solved independently and the results of these sub-problems are used for  overlapping sub-problems.
      → This is used where we have problems, which can be further divided into similar sub-problems, so that their results can be re-used.
   
► Important points :-
     
    → Here. In this Approach, the problem should be able to be divided into smaller overlapping sub-problem.
    → An optimum solution can be achieved by using an optimum solution of smaller sub-problems.
    → Dynamic algorithms use Memoization.
    → Dynamic programming can be used in both top-down and bottom-up manner.
    
• Let's see the example How the computer problems can be solved using the Dynamic Programming Approach :-
       
      1. Fibonacci number series
      2. Knapsack problem
      3. Tower of Hanoi
      4. All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall
      5. Shortest path by Dijkstra
      6. Project scheduling
       
• Following are the significance of Dynamic Programming -
    → Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
    → Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.
    → Compute the optimal solution, typically bottom-up
    → Construct the path of an optimal solution.
